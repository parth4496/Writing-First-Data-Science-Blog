## Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a>

Being an aspiring Data Scientist, Stack Overflow is a website that I refer to every single day because it helps to solve your programming problems where people from around the globe can comment on it and help optimize it. In this project we will be using a dataset which holds survey results. We will perform the CRISP-DM process on the data to analyze certain questions.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I am an international student based in United States. I want to explore the differences between Western country trends (North America, Europe) and Eastern country trends.

1) Are people Overpaid or not, globally?
2) What are the Salary differences in western countries and eastern countries, roughly?
3) Are people satisfied with their job?

With all those questions answered, Where will you prefer to work?


## Data <a name="data"></a>

The notebook available here includes the analysis of the above questions.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@patel.parth4496/writing-my-first-data-science-blog-17b9f8cd8d58?sk=0309d570b9fd623f366dc9aa257374d8).

## Acknowledgements<a name="Acknowledgements"></a>

StackOverflow should be credited for this survey and survey results. You can find  the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
